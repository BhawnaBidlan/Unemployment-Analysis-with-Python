# Unemployment-Analysis-with-Python
The notebook `Unemployment Analysis.ipynb` contains 26 cells, with a mix of code and markdown cells. Below is a detailed description of the notebook's content:

### 1. **Library Imports**
   - The notebook begins by importing essential Python libraries:
     - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
     - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
     - **Seaborn and Matplotlib**: For data visualization.

### 2. **Data Loading**
   - Two CSV files are loaded into Pandas DataFrames:
     - `Unemployment in India.csv`
     - `Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv`
   - These datasets likely contain information on unemployment rates, employment statistics, and labor participation across various regions and time periods in India.

### 3. **Initial Data Exploration**
   - The `head()` function is used to display the first few rows of each dataset, providing an initial overview of the data structure.
   - The columns of both datasets are examined to understand the attributes available in the data:
     - For the first dataset (`data`), columns include `Region`, `Date`, `Frequency`, `Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)`, `Estimated Employed`, `Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)`, and `Area`.
     - The second dataset (`data1`) has additional columns like `Region`, `longitude`, and `latitude`.

### 4. **Column Renaming**
   - The columns in both datasets are renamed to more standardized and concise names:
     - For example, in the first dataset:
       - `Region` is renamed to `State`
       - `Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)` is renamed to `Estimated.Unemployment.Rate`
       - `Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)` is renamed to `Estimated.Labour.Participation.Rate`
     - Similar renaming is done for the second dataset.

### 5. **Data Analysis**
   - Although not fully detailed in the first few cells, the notebook is expected to contain further analysis, such as:
     - Visualizing unemployment trends across different regions and time periods.
     - Correlating unemployment rates with other economic indicators like labor participation.
     - Possibly analyzing geographical trends using the latitude and longitude data.

### 6. **Data Visualization **
   - Given the import of Seaborn and Matplotlib, the notebook is likely to include various plots and graphs to illustrate trends and insights derived from the data.
   - Visualization types might include line plots for trends over time, bar charts for regional comparisons, and possibly scatter plots for correlations.

### 7. **Conclusions and Insights**
   - The notebook might conclude with insights or observations based on the analysis, such as identifying regions with the highest unemployment rates or periods of significant change.
